# Semantic Framework

**Semantic Framework** is a simple full-stack [Semantic Web](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)/[Linked Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data) application development kit, to develop knowledge-driven "Semantic Web"-ready applications by bringing ontologies as a fully operational backend for both models and logics behind web applications.

Its template engine is plugged as a complement to the semantic organization of web applications, features modern user experiences.


## Semantic-View Pattern

Semantic Framework extends SWRL and OWL, implementing proof of concept for Semantic-View software pattern. Comparing to MVC, SV provides models and logics behind an application via modern semantic web solutions (OWL, SWRL, and SPARQL).

[ ] TODO: Describe the pattern (snippets from the draft proposal).
